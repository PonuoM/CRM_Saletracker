# Sidebar Highlighting and Back Button Fix Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Missing Back Button on User Management Page
**Problem**: The user management page (`admin.php?action=users`) did not have a "Back" button to return to the Admin Dashboard.

**Solution**: Added a "Back" button to the user management page that links to `admin.php` (Admin Dashboard).

**Files Modified**:
- `app/views/admin/users/index.php`

**Changes Made**:
```diff
+ <a href="admin.php" class="btn btn-secondary me-2">
+     <i class="fas fa-arrow-left me-2"></i>ย้อนกลับ
+ </a>
```

### 2. Sidebar Highlighting Issue for Workflow Management and Customer Distribution
**Problem**: When navigating to "Workflow Management" (`admin.php?action=workflow`) and "Customer Distribution" (`admin.php?action=customer_distribution`) pages, the corresponding sidebar menu items were not highlighted in green, and the sidebar seemed to "jump" to highlight the "Admin Dashboard" instead.

**Root Cause**: The menu items for Workflow Management and Customer Distribution were missing the active state logic in the sidebar component.

**Solution**: Added the proper active state conditions to both menu items in the sidebar.

**Files Modified**:
- `app/views/components/sidebar.php`

**Changes Made**:
```diff
- <a class="nav-link" href="admin.php?action=workflow">
+ <a class="nav-link <?php echo ($currentPage === 'admin' && $currentAction === 'workflow') ? 'active' : ''; ?>" href="admin.php?action=workflow">

- <a class="nav-link" href="admin.php?action=customer_distribution">
+ <a class="nav-link <?php echo ($currentPage === 'admin' && $currentAction === 'customer_distribution') ? 'active' : ''; ?>" href="admin.php?action=customer_distribution">
```

## Technical Details

### Sidebar Active State Logic
The sidebar uses the following variables to determine which menu item should be highlighted:
- `$currentPage`: The current PHP file name (e.g., 'admin')
- `$currentAction`: The 'action' parameter from the URL (e.g., 'workflow', 'customer_distribution')

The active state is applied when both conditions are met:
- `$currentPage === 'admin'` (we're on the admin.php page)
- `$currentAction === 'specific_action'` (we're on a specific admin action)

### CSS Classes
The active state applies the `active` CSS class, which typically includes:
- Green background color
- White text color
- Bold font weight

## Testing

### Back Button
1. Navigate to `admin.php?action=users`
2. Verify the "ย้อนกลับ" (Back) button is visible next to the "เพิ่มผู้ใช้ใหม่" (Add New User) button
3. Click the back button and verify it takes you to the Admin Dashboard (`admin.php`)

### Sidebar Highlighting
1. Navigate to `admin.php?action=workflow`
2. Verify the "Workflow Management" menu item in the sidebar is highlighted in green
3. Navigate to `admin.php?action=customer_distribution`
4. Verify the "ระบบแจกลูกค้า" (Customer Distribution) menu item in the sidebar is highlighted in green
5. Verify that the Admin Dashboard menu item is not highlighted when on these pages

## Status
✅ **Completed**: Both issues have been resolved
- Back button added to user management page
- Sidebar highlighting fixed for Workflow Management and Customer Distribution pages

## Impact
- Improved user experience with better navigation
- Consistent sidebar highlighting across all admin pages
- Clear visual feedback for current page location
