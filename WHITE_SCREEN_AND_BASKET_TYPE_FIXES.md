# White Screen and Basket Type Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. White Screen After Download/Upload Operations
**Problem**: After downloading import example files or uploading files to add data, the screen turns white with no information, requiring a sidebar selection to reset.

**Root Cause**: 
- Download template links were not opening in new tabs, causing page navigation issues
- Import operations were not properly refreshing the page after completion

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Modified download template links** in `app/views/import-export/index.php`:
   - Added `target="_blank"` to both sales and customers template download links
   - This prevents the main page from navigating away during download

2. **Added page refresh logic** in `assets/js/import-export.js`:
   - Added automatic page refresh after successful import operations
   - 3-second delay to allow users to see the success message before refresh
   - Applied to both sales import and customers-only import functions

### 2. White Screen on Product Deletion
**Problem**: Deleting items results in a white screen.

**Root Cause**: Missing `delete.php` view file for products in the admin controller.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Created missing delete view file** `app/views/admin/products/delete.php`:
   - Complete delete confirmation page with product details
   - Proper form handling with POST method
   - Error handling and user feedback
   - Confirmation dialog and cancel options

### 3. Basket Type Logic Issue
**Problem**: When a follower (`ผู้ติดตาม`) is added during import, the `basket_type` in the `customers` table should be `assigned` instead of remaining in the "distribution basket" (`ตะกร้าแจก`).

**Root Cause**: The import logic was always setting `basket_type` to `'distribution'` regardless of whether a follower was assigned.

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Modified `importCustomersFromCSV()` method** in `app/services/ImportExportService.php`:
   - Added logic to check if `assigned_to` is provided
   - Set `basket_type` to `'assigned'` when a follower is assigned
   - Set `basket_type` to `'distribution'` when no follower is assigned

2. **Modified `createNewCustomer()` method** in `app/services/ImportExportService.php`:
   - Added `$basketType` variable to determine basket type based on follower assignment
   - Updated the customer data array to use the dynamic basket type

3. **Modified `createNewCustomerOnly()` method** in `app/services/ImportExportService.php`:
   - Applied the same basket type logic for customers-only import
   - Ensures consistency across all import methods

## Technical Details

### Basket Type Logic
```php
// Set basket_type based on whether a follower is assigned
if ($assignedTo) {
    $customerData['basket_type'] = 'assigned'; // มีผู้ติดตามแล้ว
} else {
    $customerData['basket_type'] = 'distribution'; // อยู่ในตะกร้าแจก
}
```

### Page Refresh Logic
```javascript
// Refresh page after successful import to show updated data
setTimeout(() => {
    window.location.reload();
}, 3000);
```

### Download Template Links
```html
<a href="import-export.php?action=downloadTemplate&type=sales" 
   class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-sm" target="_blank">
    <i class="fas fa-download me-1"></i>
    ดาวน์โหลด Template ยอดขาย
</a>
```

## Files Modified

1. **`app/views/admin/products/delete.php`** - Created new file
2. **`app/services/ImportExportService.php`** - Modified basket type logic
3. **`app/views/import-export/index.php`** - Added target="_blank" to download links
4. **`assets/js/import-export.js`** - Added page refresh logic

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Download Operations**:
   - Click download template links for both sales and customers
   - Verify files download without affecting the main page
   - Confirm page remains functional after download

2. **Test Import Operations**:
   - Upload CSV files for both sales and customers import
   - Verify success messages appear
   - Confirm page automatically refreshes after 3 seconds
   - Check that imported data appears correctly

3. **Test Product Deletion**:
   - Navigate to product list
   - Click delete button on any product
   - Verify delete confirmation page appears
   - Test both successful deletion and cancellation

4. **Test Basket Type Logic**:
   - Import customers with assigned followers
   - Verify `basket_type` is set to `'assigned'` in database
   - Import customers without followers
   - Verify `basket_type` is set to `'distribution'` in database

## Expected Results

- ✅ Download operations no longer cause white screens
- ✅ Upload operations complete successfully and refresh the page
- ✅ Product deletion shows proper confirmation page
- ✅ Customers with followers are assigned to `'assigned'` basket type
- ✅ Customers without followers remain in `'distribution'` basket type
- ✅ All operations provide proper user feedback and error handling
