# Cron Job Fix Summary

## Issue
The cron job was failing with database connection errors because it was incorrectly using development database settings (root user with no password) instead of production settings when running on the production server.

## Root Cause
The environment detection logic in `config/config.php` only checked for `$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']` which is not available when running via CLI (Command Line Interface). This caused the system to default to development settings.

## Solution
Enhanced the environment detection in `config/config.php` to also check the file path when running from CLI:

```php
// สำหรับ CLI scripts (เช่น cron jobs) ตรวจสอบจาก path แทน
if (php_sapi_name() === 'cli') {
    $is_production = (strpos(__DIR__, '/home/primacom/domains/prima49.com/') !== false);
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `config/config.php` - Enhanced environment detection
2. `cron/run_all_jobs.php` - Improved logging and error handling
3. Created `cron/cron_execution_log.txt` - Detailed execution log file

## Files Added
1. `test_database_connection.php` - Test script to verify database connectivity
2. `CRON_JOB_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Comprehensive documentation
3. `CRON_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This summary file

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and is ready for deployment. The cron job should now correctly detect the production environment and use the appropriate database credentials.

## Verification Steps
1. Deploy the updated `config/config.php` file to production
2. Run the cron job manually to verify it works:
   ```
   php cron/run_all_jobs.php
   ```
3. Check the log files for successful execution
4. Verify entries are created in the `cron_job_logs` database table
